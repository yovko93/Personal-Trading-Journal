# Tradovate CSV Import

M10.1 provides only the parsing and source-normalization foundation for a future Tradovate import workflow. It does not reconstruct executions or Trades, resolve Instruments or accounts, show an import preview, or persist any data.

## Supported source contract

The parser recognizes the following required headers by their exact, case-sensitive names:

```text
symbol,_priceFormat,_priceFormatType,_tickSize,buyFillId,sellFillId,qty,buyPrice,sellPrice,pnl,boughtTimestamp,soldTimestamp,duration
```

All 13 headers are required, but their order may vary. Empty, duplicate, or missing headers make the file unusable. Additional columns are ignored with a warning so that they cannot be mistaken for required data. UTF-8 input with or without a BOM, CRLF or LF line endings, quoted fields, embedded commas, escaped quotes, and safely ignorable blank lines are supported.

Each accepted data row becomes a `TradovateMatchedFillRow` carrying its source record index and starting line number. Invalid records are not silently skipped: the parse result includes error diagnostics, valid and rejected counts, and an indication of whether the header is usable and the complete input is valid.

## Matched-fill semantics

A source row describes a matched quantity between a buy fill and a sell fill. It is not necessarily a complete execution and is not a Trade. The same `buyFillId` or `sellFillId` may occur in multiple rows; identifiers are preserved as strings, including leading zeros, and are not deduplicated. `MatchedQuantity` describes only the quantity represented by that row.

The parser preserves the broker contract symbol, such as `MNQU6`, rather than reducing it to a canonical Instrument symbol. `_priceFormat` and `_priceFormatType` remain uninterpreted source metadata. `_tickSize`, quantity, prices, and source-reported P&L use exact decimal arithmetic. Futures quantities must be positive whole contracts, and tick size must be positive.

`SourceReportedPnL` accepts invariant dollar notation, including positive, zero, leading-minus negative, and accounting-style negative values. It is the broker-reported result for one matched row, not authoritative `Trade.NetPnL`. The export contains no independent commission, exchange-fee, or broker-fee fields, so the parser does not infer them.

## Time and duration

Timestamps must use the exact invariant format `MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss`. Because the export declares neither a timezone nor an offset, the normalized values are `DateTime` instances with `DateTimeKind.Unspecified`. No machine-local or UTC conversion occurs. A sell timestamp earlier than a buy timestamp is accepted because it can describe short-side activity.

The `duration` value is preserved as source text. It is not recalculated, parsed into business meaning, or used to infer direction or grouping.

## Validation and diagnostics

Expected source problems produce structured diagnostics containing severity, a stable code, source record and line locations where available, the affected field, and a concise message. Validation covers header shape, CSV record shape, required identifiers and symbol, exact numeric syntax and ranges, supported P&L notation, and timestamps. An invalid row is rejected without defaulting malformed values to zero, one, or the current time. Successfully parsed rows may still be returned, but any rejected row makes the complete input unsafe for automatic import.

The parser is deterministic and leaves ownership of the input stream with its caller. It honors cancellation and does not turn cancellation, memory failures, or unrelated I/O failures into ordinary parse diagnostics.

## Later M10 stages

Trade reconstruction remains a separate step. It will analyze repeated fill identifiers, matched quantities, execution consistency, event ordering, flat-to-flat grouping, and ambiguous or incomplete lifecycles.

Instrument resolution will later map contract symbols to canonical Instruments. Missing Instruments may be proposed with source metadata, reviewed and corrected in Import Preview, and persisted only after confirmation; tick value, currency, and other economics must not be inferred from `_tickSize` alone. Later stages will also select or map the Trading Account, apply an explicitly configured timezone, confirm the import, persist it transactionally, and provide durable deduplication.

The original `Tradovate-A049.csv` contains private trading activity and must remain untracked. Synthetic fixtures are used for automated tests. Full-file validation is local-only when the original file is explicitly made available.
